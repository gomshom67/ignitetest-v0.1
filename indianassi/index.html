                    Looking back, Ignite completely changed my life. I went from feeling lost 
                    and broken to experiencing God's miraculous healing and restoration. Receiving <br>
                    the Holy Spirit at the retreat was life-changing, and now I know I'm a child of 
                    God, free from fear. It's amazing to see God working in my family – my kids are <br>
                    in church, my husband's heart is changing, and my eldest son is serving God. I'm 
                    so thankful for the love and support of the Ignite women; they truly showed me Christ's compassion.

                    My first Ignite retreat was a turning point when I was completely broken by <br>
                    past abuse and a struggling relationship. For years, I carried the weight of 
                    violence I witnessed as a child, feeling worthless and suicidal. But at Ignite, <br>
                    God's presence began to heal me through the team's love and prayers. I realized 
                    I am His child, not defined by my past. The final retreat brought a powerful <br>
                    release from that pain, restoring my joy and setting my soul on fire. I went 
                    from victim to victor, and even my marriage was healed. I'm now free, with a <br>
                    purpose, and hopeful for the future, all thanks to the life-changing impact of the Ignite team.

    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>
        A real-world national ministry raising up a generation for Jesus in the Catholic Church. 
<br>
        Ignite Youth has a bold vision for the future of the Church. <br>
        We are dedicated to gathering, raising up and sending out a new <br>
        generation of Catholics who are on fire for Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, <br>
        formed in the faith and centred in the Eucharist.
<br>
        We believe in real-world evangelisation; revealing Jesus Christ through a ministry <br>
        of authentic relationships. Through our national conferences, local events and relational <br>
        ministry, we see a generation who are not just changed for a day but transformed for life. <br>
        Using contemporary culture to engage their hearts and minds, our dream is to spearhead <br>
        a new evangelisation of our nation and pave a way for the Church of the future.
